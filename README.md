Simple REST API using flask

# Setup
First, you should activate the virtual environment by running:
. venv/bin/activate

Next, to start up the server you simply run:
python3 app.py

After doing this, you can use simple curl commands from the terminal to send basic HTTP requests.

There are also some unit tests in the tests folder which do effectively the same thing.
